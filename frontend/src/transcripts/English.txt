[applause] every once in a while a revolutionary product comes along that changes everything and apple has been well first of all one's very fortunate if you get to work on just one of these in your career apple's been very fortunate it's been able to introduce a few of these into the world 1984 we introduced the macintosh it didn't just change apple it changed the whole computer industry in 2001 we introduced the first ipod and it didn't just it didn't just change the way we all listen to music it changed the entire music industry well today we're introducing three revolutionary products of this class the first one is a widescreen ipod with touch controls the second is a revolutionary mobile phone and the third is a breakthrough internet communications device so three things a widescreen ipod with touch controls a revolutionary mobile phone and a breakthrough internet communications device an ipod a phone and an internet communicator an ipod a phone are you getting it these are not three separate devices this is one device and we are calling it iphone today today apple is going to reinvent the phone and here it is [laughter] no actually here it is but we're going to leave it there for now so before we get into it let me uh let me talk about a category of things the most advanced phones are called smartphones so they say and uh they typically combine a phone plus some email capability plus they say it's the internet sort of the baby internet into one device and they all have these plastic little keyboards on them uh and the problem is that they're not so smart and they're not so easy to use so if you kind of make a you know business school 101 graph with a smart access and the easy to use access phones regular cell phones are kind of right there they're not so smart and they're you know not so easy to use but smartphones are definitely a little smarter but they actually are harder to use they're really complicated just for the basic stuff people have a hard time figuring out how to use them well we don't want to do either one of these things what we want to do is make a leapfrog product that is way smarter than any mobile device has ever been and super easy to use this is what iphone is No now who wants a stylist you have to get them and put them away and you lose them yuck nobody wants a stylus so let's not use a stylus we're going to use the best pointing device in the world we're going to use a pointing device that we're all born with we're born with ten of them we're gonna use our fingers we're gonna touch this with our fingers and we have invented a new technology called multi-touch which is phenomenal it works like magic you don't need a stylus it's far more accurate than any touch display that's ever been shipped it ignores unintended touches it's super smart you can do multi-finger gestures on it and boy have we patented it. Every application wants a slightly different user interface a slightly optimized set of buttons just for it and what happens if you think of a great idea six months from now you can't run around and add a button to these things they're already shipped so what do you do it doesn't work because the buttons and the controls can't change they can't change for each application and they can't change down the road if you think of another great idea you want to add to this product well how do you solve this it turns out we have solved it we solved it in computers 20 years ago we solved it with a bitmap screen that could display anything we want put any user interface up and a pointing device we solved it with the mouse. And now we're going to bring multi-touch to the market and each of these revolutionary user interfaces has made possible a revolutionary product the mac the ipod and now the iphone so a revolutionary user interface we're going to build on top of that with software now software on mobile phones is like Now why why would we want to run such a sophisticated operating system on a mobile device well because it's got everything we need it's got multitasking it's got the best networking it already knows how to power manage we've been doing this on mobile computers for years it's got awesome security and the right apps it's got everything from coco and the graphics. It's like baby software it's not so powerful and today we're going to show you a software breakthrough software that's at least five years ahead of what's on any other phone now how do we do this well we start with a strong foundation iphone runs os 10.
